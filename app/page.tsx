          Hey there! I&rsquo;m <HighlightSpan>Rohit</HighlightSpan>, a software
          engineer at Figma where I spend my days building the{' '}
          <HighlightSpan>extensibility platform</HighlightSpan> that powers
          thousands of plugins, widgets, and integrations. Think of me as the
          bridge between Figma&rsquo;s incredible design tools and the creative
          minds who want to extend them.

          When I&rsquo;m not deep in code, you&rsquo;ll find me on a completely
          different creative journeyâ€”learning to become a{' '}
          <HighlightSpan>digital artist</HighlightSpan>. There&rsquo;s something
          magical about switching from building software interfaces to crafting
          visual worlds. My dream? To create an entire universe through art,
          complete with its own stories and characters.

          Life outside the screen is just as important to me. I&rsquo;m that
          person who gets genuinely excited about a perfect{' '}
          <HighlightSpan>tennis serve</HighlightSpan>, spends weekends
          experimenting with <HighlightSpan>homemade ice cream</HighlightSpan>{' '}
          flavors (lavender honey is my latest obsession), and loses track of
          time in epic <HighlightSpan>gaming sessions</HighlightSpan>.

          While I&rsquo;m happily settled at Figma, I&rsquo;m always up for
          interesting conversations about technology, creativity, or that perfect
          ice cream recipe. Let&rsquo;s connect!
